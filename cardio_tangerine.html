                    <h2 align="center">Cardio</h2>
                    <p>Tangerine Fit Cardio is designed for athletes to make the most out of their time on cardio machines. Each of our two cardio versions are designed in order to maximize results in a minimal amount of time. We combine techniques in order to ensure that our athletes meet their goals.</p>
                    <h2 align="center">Fat Loss</h2>
                    <p>Our Fat Loss routines are designed to keep you heart rate around 130bpm, which is considered to be the best area to burn fat. We do this through techniques of fast movement and slower movement switching off, never allowing you heart to get much further above that zone, or too far below it.</p>
                    <h2 align="center">Conditioning</h2>
                    <p>Our Conditioning routines are designed in order to keep your heart rate elevated and lungs working, but will also allow our athletes to push themselves through periodic moments of fast movement. This will ensure that our athletes never lose progress, but are always moving forward.</p>
                    <p>We recommend attempting whichever routine fits your fitness goals. However, we also recommend occasionally mixing the other routine into your regiment. These workouts can be performed as a standalone workout, or after a weightlifting routine.</p>
