                            <p><u>Form</u>: For deadlifts, stand with a neutral stance. Bend over at the hips with an arched back in order to pick up the dumbbells. Lean back slightly with the legs but keep them at about an 80 degree angle. Using the hamstrings and glutes, bring the bar up until you are standing straight. Lower the bar back down to the floor.</p>
                            <p>For the calf raises, stand on an elevated surface so that your heels are hanging off the step, lower your heels so that it stretches the calves. Flex your calves and move so that you’re standing on your tippy-toes to contract the calves. Lower yourself slowly back to the starting position.</p>

                            <p><u>Info</u>: There will be 6 sets. Focus on control and depth. Every 2 sets, increase the weight 10-15% and decrease the repetitions. For the final 2 sets, split the set into 2 parts of 4 repetitions with a 20 second break in between.</p>
                            <p><u>Form</u>: Place your feet just outside of a normal standing position. Point your toes at about a 30 degree angle outward. With an arch in your back, sit back so that the bar travels in a straight line as you squat. Lower yourself all the way until your glutes nearly touch your ankles. Make sure that your heels do not come off the ground and that you stay flat footed. Push through your heels to bring yourself back upward.</p>
