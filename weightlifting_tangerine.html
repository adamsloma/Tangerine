        <h1 align="center">Weightlifting</h1><br>
        <p>Tangerine Fit Weightlifting is designed for athletes to make the most out of their time in the gym.
          Each exercise routine is constructed from the ground up to ensure that the user can build the maximum
          amount of muscle and not spend hours in the gym.</p><br>
        <h2 align="center">101 Series</h2><br>
        <p>Our 101 series is designed for beginners in the weightroom to ensure that aspiring athletes are
          able to build a solid foundation. At Tangerine Fit, we place an emphasis on control and form while
          performing our exercises, and the 101 series allows althletes to get comfortable with exercises
          while still building muscle.</p><br>
        <h2 align="center">102 Series</h2><br>
        <p>The 102 series is designed for intermediate athletes. These workouts are much more taxing on
          the body and include advanced lifting techniques, such as dropsets and supersets. We recommend
          that athletes perform our 101 series before attempting the 102 series to ensure that they are
          comfortable with the Tangerine Fit Weightlifting style.</p><br>
        <h2 align="center">103 Series</h2><br>
        <p>The 103 series is designed with the advanced weightlifting athlete in mind. We recommend
          athletes perform both our 101 and 102 series for an extended period of time before attempting
          the 103 series. This series is tailored for athletes with a solid foundation and a substantial
          amount of mass in the targeted muscle group.</p><br>
        <h2 align="center">Tangerine Fit Training Regiment</h2><br>
        <p>We recommend attempting the 101 series for up to 2 months to build a foundation. We then
          suggest attempting the 102 series for up to 2 months once our athletes are accustomed to
          the 101 series. Next, we believe that our athletes should transition back to the 101 series
          to perform those routines for up to 2 more months with the strength they have built over the
          last 4 months. Next, we have our athletes perform the 102 series once again for up to 2
          more months. If our athletes feel comfortable after these 6 months of training, we urge them
          to try the 103 series with lighter weight for up to 2 months before transitioning back to the
          102 series with newly found strength and mass for up to 2 months. After that, we feel our
          athletes will be able to handle the 103 series with heavier weight. This allows our athletes to
          train and maximize muscle growth of the period of a year and get them accostomed to a variety
          of exercises in the weightroom.</p>
